# Requirements

To run osnap.wlua, you'll need:

- [Lua](http://lua.org)
- [IUPLua](http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/)
- [IMLua](http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/im/)
- [LuaGL](http://luagl.sourceforge.net/)

On Windows, you can get all this and more by installing [Lua for Windows](http://code.google.com/p/luaforwindows/downloads/detail?name=LuaForWindows_v5.1.4-45.exe).

Outside of Windows, check your local package manager (which will most likely have packages for Lua) and/or Sourceforge (there are some good tips out there for setting up the files you can get from Sourceforge if you search for them).

# Running

Run osnap.wlua with a Lua interpreter like wlua.exe for Windows.
